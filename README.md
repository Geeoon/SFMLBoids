Boids using SFML

Boids were created by Craig Reynolds to simulate flocks, herds, and schools.
Boid follow 3 basic rules:
* Seperation
  * Steer to avoid crowding local flockmates
* Alignment
  * Steer towards the average heading of local flockmates
* Cohesion
  * Steer to move towards the average position (center of mass) of local flockmates

If you want to know more about how Boids work, visit the [wikipeida page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids) or Craig Reynolds's [website](https://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/).
